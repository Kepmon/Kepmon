## üôãÔ∏è About me
* I'm a highly motivated and passionate front-end programmer with a strong desire to kick-start my professional career. 
* My primary focus is to write clean, readable and maintainable code, and to assure the best possible performance of websites. I am well-equipped to do so, due to the following:
    * I have first-hand experience participating in code reviews and refactoring my own code based on those (see the pull requests [here](https://github.com/Kepmon/Website_ZChA/pulls) or [here](https://github.com/Kepmon/task-manager/pulls), if interested), so I know what is it like going back to your code and wondering what's going on there
    * I also happen to be a perfectionist, therefore, I intend to make a complete code refactoring for all my existing projects - I already managed to do this with one of them and - due to the lack of time - the rest are waiting for their turn
* Making websites accessible for everyone is also one of my top priorities. Therefore, when writing my personal projects, I implement solutions that allow both keyboard-navigating users, as well as the screen-reader users, to easily navigate through the website/app. Currently, I use the [Silktide website accessibility simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/silktide-website-accessib/okcpiimdfkpkjcbihbmhppldhiebhhaf) as well as the [NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) to be able to perceive the web the way that people with disabilities do. However, I'm open to any tool recommendations that would allow me to enhance my accessibility skills.
* Although at the moment I'm focused on developing my front-end skills, I do intend to learn some back-end technologies (e.g. Node.js/Express.js) as well, since I strongly believe that the broader your knowledge is, the better developer you make.

## üéì Currently learning
‚úì Practicing **Vue.js** by making [this app](https://github.com/Kepmon/task-manager).  
‚úì Intending to learn **Nuxt 3** as soon as I finish writing the abovementioned app. Planning to do so just by writing some next app (learning by doing) since I already watched some crash course on the topic and I think I'll be fine just with docs.

### Projects' description:
<details>
  <summary>1. Task Manager</summary>
  
  #### Status
  _In progress_

  #### Description  
The website/app is a [Frontendmentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB) and currently it is still being created. The main purpose of writing this app is practicing Vue and TypeScript. Usually, I prefer to create my own projects, instead of using the Frontendmentor challenges, however, I decided to take this one for several reasons:
* When I discovered Trello, I thought I'd like to write a similar app. But I don't feel like having a good eye for design and didn't want to spend much time on designing the app anyway, therefore, when I accidentally found this challenge on Frontendmentor I thought this would be a perfect solution for me.
* I felt like I actually should practice working with the design files, since it was my understanding that's what I would be doing in an actual job.
* I believe this app would be an interesting base for converting to the desktop app, using Electron, which I intend to learn in the future.

Nevertheless, I decided to enhance the functionality proposed by the Frontendmentor creators by connecting it to Firebase, so a user is able to create an account and store all data.

  <summary>2. Workout Planner</summary>

  #### Status
  _Needing minor refactoring_

  #### Description  
The website was created with the intent of practicing Vue. Initially
written with Options API and JavaScript but rewritten later on to Composition
API and Typescript. The website allows to create workout routines and was
connected to Supabase, so the user can create and store their workouts.
Still needing an improvement of some UX and accessibility aspects, which is intended to be done in the future.

<details>
  <summary>3. ZChA Website</summary>

  #### Status
  _Finished for now but may be further refactored in the future_

  #### Description  
This website was my first one, created to gain some experience in
coding after finishing a number of courses on HTML, CSS, and JS. Inspired by
the actual Department‚Äôs website but adapted to the newest standards of
coding.

About a half a year from finishing it, I recognized that it required a complete
code refactoring, which has been done recently, so the website meets the criteria of
the code maintainability, performance, and accessibility to the highest possible
level.

Although it's a simple website, it reflects well my current knowledge on the best practices of writing code.

<details>
  <summary>4. Calorie Calculator</summary>

  #### Status
  _Needing major refactoring_

  #### Description  
The main purpose of creating this website was to practice some JS, during my learning process. However, I also intended to address some elements that I found to be lacking in similar calculators available online. As the name implies, the website provides the caloric demand based on the data provided by a user.

Since the website was written over half a year ago, it requires a major refactoring, with a particular emphasis on the code quality and accessibility. Intended to be rewritten with TypeScript, ESLint, and ‚Äì possibly ‚Äì Astro and Tailwind CSS.

<details>
  <summary>5. Recipe Finder</summary>

  #### Status
  _Needing major refactoring_

  #### Description  
The main purpose of creating this website was to practice working with the REST API, during my learning process. The website serves for finding recipes based on criteria provided by a user.  

This website also needs a major improvements, with a particular emphasis on its design. As for the code, part of it was reviewed by an experienced developer (outside Github, so there are no pull requests), however, there is probably much room for improvement in it as well. Intended to be done in the future, using TypeScript, ESLint, and ‚Äì possibly ‚Äì Astro and Tailwind CSS.
