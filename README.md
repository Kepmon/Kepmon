## üôãÔ∏è About me
* I'm a highly motivated and passionate front-end programmer with a strong desire to kick-start my professional career. 
* My primary focus is to write clean, readable and maintainable code, and to assure the best possible performance of websites. I am well-equipped to do so, due to the following:
    * I have first-hand experience participating in code reviews, and I've been refactoring my code based on the feedback I received (see the pull requests [here](https://github.com/Kepmon/Website_ZChA/pulls) or [here](https://github.com/Kepmon/task-manager/pulls), if interested). Therefore, I know what it is like going back to your code and wondering what's going on there.
    * I also happen to be a perfectionist, and therefore, I intend to make a complete code refactoring for all my existing projects - I already managed to do this with one of them and - due to the lack of time - the rest are waiting for their turn.
* Making websites accessible for everyone is also one of my top priorities. Therefore, when writing my personal projects, I implement solutions that allow both keyboard-navigating users, as well as screen-reader users, to easily navigate through the website/app. Currently, I use the [Silktide website accessibility simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/silktide-website-accessib/okcpiimdfkpkjcbihbmhppldhiebhhaf) as well as the [NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) to be able to perceive the web the way that people with disabilities do. However, I'm open to any tool recommendations that would allow me to enhance my accessibility skills.
* Although at the moment I'm focused on developing my front-end skills, I do intend to learn some back-end technologies (e.g. Node.js/Express.js, Bun, C#), as well since I strongly believe that the broader your knowledge is, the better the developer that you make.

### Projects' description:
<details>
  <summary>1. Task Manager</summary>
  
  #### Status
  _Needing some refactoring_

  #### Description  
**Update**  
Currently, the whole functionality of the app is working, however, the app still requires many improvements that are meant to be made in the upcoming days.

Nevertheless, at present, this is my most advanced app that pictures my currrent best. I highly encourage you to read [the project's description](https://github.com/Kepmon/task-manager) to find out about:
* the details on the app's functionality,
* the accessiiblity concerns,
* the UX aspects that I took care of
* what did I learn out of it
* what is still to be improved

## 
The website/app is a [Frontendmentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB). The main purpose of writing this app is to practice Vue and TypeScript. Usually I prefer to create my own projects instead of making use of the Frontendmentor challenges, however, I decided to take this one for several reasons:
* When I discovered Trello, I thought I'd like to write a similar app. But I don't feel that I have a good eye for design and I didn't want to spend much time on designing the app, anyway. Therefore, when I accidentally found this challenge on Frontendmentor, I thought this would be a perfect solution for me.
* I felt like I should actually practice working with design files, since it is my understanding that's what I would be doing in an actual job.
* I believe that this app would be an interesting base for converting to a desktop app using Electron, which I intend to learn in the future.

Apart from the functionality proposed by the Frontendmentor creators, I decided to enhance it by connecting the project to Firebase, so users are able to create an account and store their data.

  <summary>2. Devjobs Website</summary>
  
  #### Status
  _Being developed_

  #### Description  
[This website](https://main--euphonious-valkyrie-eb9208.netlify.app/) is a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/devjobs-web-app-HuvC_LP4l) that I took on in order to get more familiarity with the SSG and SSR rendering modes, since all of my "more advanced" apps/websites are written using Vue.js that makes use of SPA, and I wanted to try something new. In this project, I'm using the [xata](https://xata.io/) platform for storing all the data that I was given from Frontend Mentor.

At the current stage, all basic functionality works already. Nevertheless, since this is my first attempt to make an SSR website, I'm struggling with the **proper** application of certain functionalities (all my current issues are described in details in the project's README). Those are meant to be improved ASAP. Also, the accessibility is far from being on point, but I do intend to correct this in a near future.

On top of that, apart from the functionality proposed by the Frontend Mentor creators, I intend to enhance the functionality of this website by:
* allowing the users to create an account, in order to post a job offer
* applying a WYSIWYG editor, in order to improve the user experience, when posting a new job offer
* allowing the users to apply for a job

  <summary>3. Workout Planner</summary>

  #### Status
  _Needing minor refactoring_

  #### Description  
The website was created with the intent of practicing Vue. Initially written with Options API and JavaScript but I then substituted them with  Composition API and Typescript, respectively. The website allows to create workout routines and was connected to Supabase, so the user can create and store their workouts.

Still needing an improvement of some UX and accessibility aspects, which is intended to be done in the future.

<details>
  <summary>4. ZChA Website</summary>

  #### Status
  _Finished for now but may be further refactored in the future_

  #### Description  
This website was my first one, created to gain some experience in
coding after finishing a number of courses on HTML, CSS, and JS. Inspired by
the actual Department‚Äôs website but adapted to the newest standards of
coding.

About a half a year from finishing it, I recognized that it required a complete
code refactoring, which has been done recently, so the website meets the criteria of
the code maintainability, performance, and accessibility to the highest possible
level.

Although it's a simple website, it reflects quite well my current knowledge on the best practices of writing code.

<details>
  <summary>5. Calorie Calculator</summary>

  #### Status
  _Needing major refactoring_

  #### Description  
The main purpose of creating this website was to practice some JS, during my learning process. However, I also intended to address some elements that I found to be lacking in similar calculators available online. As the name implies, the website provides the caloric demand based on the data provided by a user.

Since the website was written almost a year ago, it requires a major refactoring, with a particular emphasis on the code quality and accessibility. Intended to be rewritten with TypeScript, ESLint, and ‚Äì possibly ‚Äì Astro and Tailwind CSS.

<details>
  <summary>6. Recipe Finder</summary>

  #### Status
  _Needing major refactoring_

  #### Description  
The main purpose of creating this website was to practice working with the REST API, during my learning process. The website serves for finding recipes based on criteria provided by a user.  

This website also needs major improvements, with a particular emphasis on its design. As for the code, part of it was reviewed (outside Github, so there are no pull requests) by an experienced developer, however, there is probably much room for improvement in it, as well. Intended to be done in the future, using TypeScript, ESLint, and ‚Äì possibly ‚Äì Astro and Tailwind CSS.
